* Write headings in a logical sequence. Section titles read out in order should present a good storyline for the doc.

* Do not skip heading levels â€“ try to keep in headings in level order, rather than, for example, jumping from `h2` to `h4`.

* Try not to have a heading with no paragraph text to accompany it. Add at least an overview or intro to what comes next.

* All headings are in sentence case. This means only the first word and proper nouns are capitalized. 

* Jekyll automatically creates an H1 heading from the doc title, so only use H2 and greater in the body of the doc.
